In this project, I will study how to build a recommendation engine for movie.

I will build two recommendation engines: 

* User Based Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Engine, which is a easier one

* Content Based Filtering Recommendation Engine, which also contains two different versions of engine. In this engine, I also applied some Natural Language Processing techniques for data processing and model building.
